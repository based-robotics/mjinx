MJINX would not exist without the contributions and inspiration from several sources:

- Simeon Nedelchev for guidance and contributions during development
- St√©phane Caron and Kevin Zakka, whose work on PINK and MINK respectively provided significant inspiration
- The MuJoCo MJX team for their excellent physics simulation tools
- IRIS lab at KAIST
