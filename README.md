**Mjinx** is a library for auto-differentiable numerical inverse kinematics, powered by **JAX** and **Mujoco MJX**. The library was heavily inspired by the similar Pinocchio-based tool [pink](https://github.com/stephane-caron/pink/tree/main) and Mujoco-based analogue [mink](https://github.com/kevinzakka/mink/tree/main).

## Key features
1. *Flexibility*. Each control problem is assembled via `Components`, which enforce desired behaviour or keeps system in a safety set. 
2. *Different solution approaches*. `JAX` (i.e. it's efficient sampling and autodifferentiation) allows to implement variety of solvers, which might be more beneficial in different scenarios.
3. *Fully Jax-compatible*. Both optimal control problem and its solver are jax-compatible: jit-compilation and automatic vectorization are available for the whole problem.
4. *Convinience*. The functionality is nicely wrapped to make the interaction with it easier.

## Installation
The package is available in PyPI registry, and could be installed via `pip`:
```python
pip install mjinx
```

Different installation versions:
1. Visualization tool `mjinx.visualization.BatchVisualizer` is available in `mjinx[visual]` 
2. To run examples, install `mjinx[examples]`
3. To install development version, install `mjinx[dev]` (preferably in editable mode)
4. To build docs, install `mjinx[docs]`
5. To install the repository with all dependencies, install `mjinx[all]`

## Usage
Here is the example of `mjinx` usage:

```python
from mujoco import mjx mjx
from mjinx.problem import Problem

# Initialize the robot model using MuJoCo
MJCF_PATH = "path_to_mjcf.xml"
mj_model = mj.MjModel.from_xml_path(MJCF_PATH)
mjx_model = mjx.put_model(mj_model)

# Create instance of the problem
problem = Problem(mjx_model)

# Add tasks to track desired behavior
frame_task = FrameTask("ee_task", cost=1, gain=20, body_name="link7")
problem.add_component(frame_task)

# Add barriers to keep robot in a safety set
joints_barrier = JointBarrier("jnt_range", gain=10)
problem.add_component(joints_barrier)

# Initialize the solver
solver = LocalIKSolver(mjx_model)

# Initializing initial condition
q0 = np.zeros(7)

# Initialize solver data
solver_data = solver.init()

# jit-compiling solve and integrate 
solve_jit = jax.jit(solver.solve)
integrate_jit = jax.jit(integrate, static_argnames=["dt"])

# === Control loop ===
for t in np.arange(0, 5, 1e-2):
    # Changing problem and compiling it
    frame_task.target_frame = np.array([0.1 * np.sin(t), 0.1 * np.cos(t), 0.1, 1, 0, 0,])
    problem_data = problem.compile()

    # Solving the instance of the problem
    opt_solution, solver_data = solve_jit(q, solver_data, problem_data)

    # Integrating
    q = integrate_jit(
        mjx_model,
        q,
        opt_solution.v_opt,
        dt,
    )
```

## Examples
The list of examples includes:
   1. `Kuka iiwa` local inverse kinematics ([single item](examples/local_ik.py), [vmap over desired trajectory](examples/local_ik_vmapped_output.py))
   2. `Kuka iiwa` global inverse kinematics ([single item](examples/global_ik.py), [vmap over desired trajectory](examples/global_ik_vmapped_output.py))
   3. `Go2` [batched squats](examples/go2_squat.py) example
   
> **Note:** The Global IK functionality is currently under development and not yet working properly as expected. It needs proper tuning and will be fixed in future updates. Use the Global IK examples with caution and expect suboptimal results.

## Acknowledgement
First of all, I would like to thank Simeon Nedelchev for his guidance and contributions during the development. Without his expertise and help, the repository would not exist.

The repository was highly inspired by [`pink`](https://github.com/stephane-caron/pink) and [`mink`](https://github.com/kevinzakka/mink). Both authors, Stéphane Caron and Kevin Zakka, deeply inspire me to study robotics and contribute to the open source. Without them, this repository would not exist.

Some utility functions in this code are taken from source code of [`MuJoCo MJX`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/tree/main/mjx). Apart from being a wonderful tool for batched computations and ML, the source code is compact yet readable and informative, and I encourage everyone to take a look at it to learn a little bit more about physical simulations, `jax`, and MuJoCo in general. 


Finally, I would like to thank [IRIS lab](http://iris.kaist.ac.kr/).
