Software References
=================

MJINX builds upon and integrates with the following software libraries:

- `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_: Autograd and XLA for high-performance machine learning research.
- `MuJoCo <https://mujoco.org/>`_: Physics engine for detailed, efficient robot simulation.
- `PINK <https://github.com/stephane-caron/pink>`_: Differentiable inverse kinematics using Pinocchio.
- `MINK <https://github.com/kevinzakka/mink>`_: MuJoCo-based inverse kinematics.

MJINX would not exist without the contributions and inspiration from several sources:

- Simeon Nedelchev for guidance and contributions during development
- St√©phane Caron and Kevin Zakka, whose work on PINK and MINK respectively provided significant inspiration
- The MuJoCo MJX team for their excellent physics simulation tools
- IRIS lab at KAIST
