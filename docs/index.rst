MJINX
####

**Mjinx** is a library for auto-differentiable numerical inverse kinematics, powered by [**JAX**](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [**Mujoco MJX**](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html). The library was heavily inspired by the similar Pinocchio-based tool [pink](https://github.com/stephane-caron/pink/tree/main).
