=============
Visualization
=============

MJINX provides utilities for visualizing robots, problem components, and optimization results. These visualization tools help with debugging, analysis, and presentation of inverse kinematics solutions.

The visualization module offers:
- Functions for rendering robot states
- Tools for visualizing task errors and barrier values
- Methods for displaying optimization trajectories
- Integration with popular plotting libraries

Using visualization alongside MJINX's computational capabilities allows for both development and deployment of robust inverse kinematics solutions.
