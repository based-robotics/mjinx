Installation
************

From PyPI
=========

Installation from the Python Package Index should work via:

.. code:: bash

    pip install mjinx

From source (developer mode)
============================

Alternatively, to test the latest updates, you could clone the repository and install it in the editable mode:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e .

As such, all the chagnes you are making during the development would be available right away without reinstalling.
