    """
    A base class for implementing barrier functions in JAX.

    This class provides a framework for creating barrier functions that can be used
    in optimization problems, particularly for constraint handling in robotics applications.

    A barrier function is defined mathematically as a function:

    .. math::

        h(q) \geq 0

    where the constraint is satisfied when h(q) is non-negative. As h(q) approaches zero,
    the barrier "activates" to prevent constraint violation. In optimization problems,
    the barrier helps enforce constraints by adding a penalty term that increases rapidly
    as the system approaches constraint boundaries.

        a displacement in joint space that helps move the system away from the constraint boundary:

    A generic barrier class that wraps atomic barrier implementations.

    This class provides a high-level interface for barrier functions, allowing

    to enforce constraints by creating a potential field that pushes the system
    away from constraint boundaries.

    In optimization problems, barriers are typically integrated as inequality constraints
    or as penalty terms in the objective function:

    .. math::

        \min_{q} f(q) \quad \text{subject to} \quad h(q) \geq 0
