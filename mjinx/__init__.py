"""Differentiable GPU-accelerated inverse kinematics based on JAX and MuJoCo MJX.

This package provides a framework for solving inverse kinematics problems using
differential programming paradigms. It leverages JAX's automatic differentiation
and GPU acceleration alongside MuJoCo MJX's physics simulation capabilities.
