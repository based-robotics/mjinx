    This class defines the interface for solvers used in inverse kinematics problems.
    Solvers transform task and barrier constraints into optimization problems, which
    can be solved to find joint configurations or velocities that satisfy the constraints.

    In general, the optimization problem can be formulated as:

    .. math::

        \min_{q} \sum_{i} \|e_i(q)\|^2_{W_i} \quad \text{subject to} \quad h_j(q) \geq 0

    where:
        - :math:`e_i(q)` are the task errors
        - :math:`W_i` are the task weight matrices
        - :math:`h_j(q)` are the barrier constraints

    Different solver implementations use different approaches to solve this problem,
    such as local linearization (QP) or global nonlinear optimization.
